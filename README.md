# demo

just view the commit history to the JSON files in this the github repository: https://github.com/aaronpkelly/gitscraper

# about

my own git scraper, inspired by [this article](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24732943)

it's an excuse to try github actions, and try out these features that git.sr.ht lacks atm:

- the automated CRON job!!!

# caveats

occasionally, you will need to pull the JSON file from the github repository into git.sr.ht, as the differences will grow day-by-day, and each new git.sr.ht pull/push will always show the differences between the oldest version of the file on git.sr.ht
